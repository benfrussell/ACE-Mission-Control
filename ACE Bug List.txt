ACE Bug List

--- BREAKING

Drone speed is hugely under-reporting for the M600
- Either need to include the Z component or switch to TOPIC_GPS_VELOCITY

Last position flag didn't appear?
- Start parameters knew the last position was available but it didn't appear until changing modes
- Start params should have changed mode automatically?
- Test

Configuration grid isn't scrollable

--- HIGH

Add hologram modem timeout detection
	- Attempt recovery by toggling the radio after a failure
		- Test

SQL should update position in the Override, Return, and once during ready/not ready

Force stop payload stopped working

Sometimes the map just dies. Usually after doing something too quickly. Reboot button?

--- MEDIUM

Set last point with set_route

Onboard computer logs aren't good.
	- Multiple logs are started. Seems to be related to the chaperone because, it causes another log file to start. Maybe check by process ID?
	- Time and date is wrong because the Pi never knows the time and date. Update it from ACE?

Route renaming doesn't update

Mission set does not provide great feedback

Mission route didn't change on map in next flythrough mode after making a change that didn't affect the entry point
- Actually not related to entry point. Seems to have just stopped updating for some reason
- This will require a lot of testing

If treatment never started we shouldn't put down a last position flag

Flythrough error does not unset?

Doesn't check the chaperone state ever past initial connection connection

--- LOW

Scroll down in Mission when opening a new tab

Disconnection causes three disconnect messages in MissionControl
	- Fixed?

Unnecessary no connection messages

--- MULTI-DRONE

Alert grid stops receiving alerts after switching between drones. CollectionChanged event sub/unsub fires properly
	- Still happens!!
	- Switched to only allow one drone as a safety workaround

Button to exclude emulation drones from the drone list

Save and restore instruction and connection details

--- FUTURE

Mission Control Core text isn't translated

Onboard Computer text isn't translated

Change to consider: You can only ever fly one route at a time... So should we just select one route in ACE
- Can we get RouteUpload objects from the UgCS server?

Reset Defaults config button(s)

When the route starts within the treatment area it sets the start point as it exits.
	- This is because it is still the "first intersection"
	- Should be easy to fix but my first attempt failed.
	- Easier to work around with different start modes. Leaving it for now.

TCP "pinging" is not reliable, at least on busy slow networks - create ping script to execute
	- Not working for Gabe
	- Should switch to using DNS-SD/mDNS to discover devices on the network 

Retrieve logs from Mission Control

--- DOCUMENTATION

Prepare manual with stage transition map
