ACE Bug List

--- BREAKING

--- HIGH

--- MEDIUM-HIGH

--- MEDIUM

Setting duration changed route
- Only sometimes

On instruction activation, 3 set route commands are sent. Can it be simplified?

Re-enabling areas on Mission Control on reconnect to OBC would be nice

Mission set does not provide great feedback

Mission route didn't change on map in next flythrough mode after making a change that didn't affect the entry point
- Actually not related to entry point. Seems to have just stopped updating for some reason
- This will require a lot of testing

If treatment never started we shouldn't put down a last position flag

Flythrough error does not unset?

Doesn't check the chaperone state ever past initial connection connection

--- LOW

Map on first load doesn't snap to the right position if you enabled an area that's set as completed

Scroll down in Mission when opening a new tab

Disconnection causes three disconnect messages in MissionControl
	- Fixed?

At mission complete, sometimes MC still shows that the area is still "in-progress"
	- Maybe related to locked/sync paused?

--- MULTI-DRONE

Re-enable import drones from UgCS

Alert grid stops receiving alerts after switching between drones. CollectionChanged event sub/unsub fires properly
	- Still happens!!
	- Switched to only allow one drone as a safety workaround
	- Make one alert grid for everyone

Button to exclude emulation drones from the drone list

--- FUTURE

Estimate time left in the treatment using flight speed, payload full-empty time, and length of route intersecting with the area

Mission Control Core text isn't translated

Onboard Computer text isn't translated

Change to consider: You can only ever fly one route at a time... So should we just select one route in ACE
- Can we get RouteUpload objects from the UgCS server?

Reset Defaults config button(s)

When the route starts within the treatment area it sets the start point as it exits.
	- This is because it is still the "first intersection"
	- Should be easy to fix but my first attempt failed.
	- Easier to work around with different start modes. Leaving it for now.

TCP "pinging" is not reliable, at least on busy slow networks - create ping script to execute
	- Not working for Gabe
	- Should switch to using DNS-SD/mDNS to discover devices on the network 

Retrieve logs from Mission Control

Better area scan algorithm. 
	- Generate node graph that covers the treatment based on the drone's swath
	- Node edges have cost based on time. 
	- The last node reached on a single flight has an edge cost of the entire return flight from that point.
	- Nodes at angles have a cost based on how long the turn would take.
	- Initial angle of approach probably has a big impact!
