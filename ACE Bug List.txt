ACE Bug List

--- CRITICAL

No way to know if the drone has been repowered and the interface has died

Alert grid stops receiving alerts after switching between drones. CollectionChanged event sub/unsub fires properly
	- Still happens!!
	- Switched to only allow one drone as a safety workaround

Force stop payload stopped working

UGCS routes don't always grab
	- Maybe it takes too long and interrupts itself?
	- Adding blocking until the requests are complete. Added more logging.

--- IMPORTANT

When the route starts within the treatment area it sets the start point as it exits.

TCP "pinging" is not reliable, at least on busy slow networks - create ping script to execute
	- Not working for Gabe

Mission Control Core text isn't translated

Onboard Computer text isn't translated

Mission Control doesn't send reset progress to the Pi when it reports an area as being in progress
	- When in Override? Related to CanBeModified?
	- Fixed?

Upload Areas should reset the progress enum?
	- Fixed?

Flythrough error does not unset?

Doesn't check the chaperone state ever past initial connection connection

Sometimes the map just dies. Usually after doing something too quickly. Reboot button?

Save and restore instruction and connection details

--- LOWER PRIORITY

Reset Defaults config button(s)

Button to exclude emulation drones from the drone list

Disconnection causes three disconnect messages in MissionControl

Sometimes the treatment areas are not grabbed 
	- Areas are added to the TreatmentInstructions - it's just the polygon is not drawn on the map
	- Maybe fixed now? Have not seen this issue for a while!

Unnecessary no connection messages

Network search is slow

ConfigEntry response causes the entire list to clone and rebuild, because it's badly done (:

--- DOCUMENTATION

Prepare manual with stage transition map
