ACE Bug List

1. Drone interface dies while the director is active
2. Mission Control requests start_interface
3. Director throws an error because the interface timed out.
The director automatically restarts the interface, but without sending a interface_status message.
Connect drone toggle fails to send start_interface because OBCClient says director is not connected.

When director throws an error during synchronize, sync commands are never processed and an error with the sync is not detected.

Sometimes the waypoint route disappears from the combobox inexplicably. Seems like the combo box sets it to null. Two-way bad?

Sometimes reordering instructions does fuck all. Drag and drop bad?

Sometimes the treatment areas are not grabbed 
	- Areas are added to the TreatmentInstructions - it's just the polygon is not drawn on the map

Need to be able to detect when the drone is RTL. Cycling activation while returning will mess up the state

Doesn't check the chaperone state ever past initial connection connection

Alert grid stops receiving alerts after switching between drones. CollectionChanged event sub/unsub fires properly

Stopped and return timer doesn't work

Disconnection causes three disconnect messages in MissionControl


Prepare manual with stage transition map
