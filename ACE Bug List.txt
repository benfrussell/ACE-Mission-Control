ACE Bug List

--- BREAKING

Drone speed is hugely under-reporting for the M600
- Try switching to TOPIC_GPS_VELOCITY
- Do in office

Need to know the time spent treated
- Test

H20 GUIDED mode can be initiated by a hold command while treating. This should stop the payload but doesn't (it's still an auto mode).
- Test

--- HIGH

Force stop payload stopped working
- Do in office

Mission Control doesn't retrieve the last position after rebooting
- Do in office

Last position flag didn't appear?
- Start parameters knew the last position was available but it didn't appear until changing modes
- Start params should have changed mode automatically?
- Seems to be related to being locked
- Test

--- MEDIUM-HIGH

SQL should update position in the Override, Return, and once during ready/not ready

Setting duration changed route

--- MEDIUM

Re-enabling areas on Mission Control on reconnect to OBC would be nice

Set last point with set_route

Onboard computer logs aren't good.
	- Multiple logs are started. Seems to be related to the chaperone because, it causes another log file to start. Maybe check by process ID?
	- Time and date is wrong because the Pi never knows the time and date. Update it from ACE?

Route renaming doesn't update

Mission set does not provide great feedback

Mission route didn't change on map in next flythrough mode after making a change that didn't affect the entry point
- Actually not related to entry point. Seems to have just stopped updating for some reason
- This will require a lot of testing

If treatment never started we shouldn't put down a last position flag

Flythrough error does not unset?

Doesn't check the chaperone state ever past initial connection connection

--- LOW

Map on first load doesn't snap to the right position if you enabled an area that's set as completed

Scroll down in Mission when opening a new tab

Disconnection causes three disconnect messages in MissionControl
	- Fixed?

At mission complete, sometimes MC still shows that the area is still "in-progress"
	- Maybe related to locked/sync paused?

--- MULTI-DRONE

Re-enable import drones from UgCS

Alert grid stops receiving alerts after switching between drones. CollectionChanged event sub/unsub fires properly
	- Still happens!!
	- Switched to only allow one drone as a safety workaround

Button to exclude emulation drones from the drone list

--- FUTURE

Estimate time left in the treatment using flight speed, payload full-empty time, and length of route intersecting with the area

Mission Control Core text isn't translated

Onboard Computer text isn't translated

Change to consider: You can only ever fly one route at a time... So should we just select one route in ACE
- Can we get RouteUpload objects from the UgCS server?

Reset Defaults config button(s)

When the route starts within the treatment area it sets the start point as it exits.
	- This is because it is still the "first intersection"
	- Should be easy to fix but my first attempt failed.
	- Easier to work around with different start modes. Leaving it for now.

TCP "pinging" is not reliable, at least on busy slow networks - create ping script to execute
	- Not working for Gabe
	- Should switch to using DNS-SD/mDNS to discover devices on the network 

Retrieve logs from Mission Control

Better area scan algorithm. 
	- Generate node graph that covers the treatment based on the drone's swath
	- Node edges have cost based on time. 
	- The last node reached on a single flight has an edge cost of the entire return flight from that point.
	- Nodes at angles have a cost based on how long the turn would take.
	- Initial angle of approach probably has a big impact!

Prepare manual with stage transition map
