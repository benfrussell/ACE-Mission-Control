ACE Bug List

--- CRITICAL

No way to know if the drone has been repowered and the interface has died

Alert grid stops receiving alerts after switching between drones. CollectionChanged event sub/unsub fires properly
	- Still happens!!
	- Switched to only allow one drone as a safety workaround

Force stop payload stopped working

UGCS routes don't always grab
	- Maybe it takes too long and interrupts itself?
	- Adding blocking until the requests are complete. Added more logging.
	- Could be fixed now?

--- IMPORTANT

TCP "pinging" is not reliable, at least on busy slow networks - create ping script to execute
	- Not working for Gabe
	- Should switch to using DNS-SD/mDNS to discover devices on the network 

Mission Control Core text isn't translated

Onboard Computer text isn't translated

Flythrough error does not unset?

Doesn't check the chaperone state ever past initial connection connection

Sometimes the map just dies. Usually after doing something too quickly. Reboot button?

Save and restore instruction and connection details

Onboard computer logs aren't good.
	- Multiple logs are started. Seems to be related to the chaperone because, it causes another log file to start. Maybe check by process ID?
	- Time and date is wrong because the Pi never knows the time and date. Update it from ACE?

--- LOWER PRIORITY

Reset Defaults config button(s)

Button to exclude emulation drones from the drone list

Disconnection causes three disconnect messages in MissionControl
	- Fixed?

Sometimes the treatment areas are not grabbed 
	- Areas are added to the TreatmentInstructions - it's just the polygon is not drawn on the map
	- Maybe fixed now? Have not seen this issue for a while!

Unnecessary no connection messages

ConfigEntry response causes the entire list to clone and rebuild, because it's badly done (:

When the route starts within the treatment area it sets the start point as it exits.
	- This is because it is still the "first intersection"
	- Should be easy to fix but my first attempt failed.
	- Easier to work around with different start modes. Leaving it for now.

--- DOCUMENTATION

Prepare manual with stage transition map
