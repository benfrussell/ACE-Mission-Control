ACE Bug List

--- BREAKING

Onboard computer can get into a state where it is synchronized but not ready
- Toggling an enabled instruction seems to fix it?
- Turning connect to drone off also did not change the ready state
- Seems caused by drone connection/disconnection
- Test

Payload is not turning off when leaving the preactivate zone
- It's fine between routes
- Test

Incorporate locked state! Got a sync error after trying to sync while the drone was on return
- Test

Thread SQL executions
- Test

Config response causes waypoint route item to disappear from the combo box in mission control
- Test

--- HIGH

Add drone auto connect
- Test

Force stop payload stopped working

Add hologram modem timeout detection
	- Attempt recovery by toggling the radio after a failure
	- Report errors if it failed to activate

Sometimes the map just dies. Usually after doing something too quickly. Reboot button?

--- MEDIUM

Route renaming doesn't update

Mission set does not provide great feedback

Mission route didn't change on map in next flythrough mode after making a change that didn't affect the entry point
- Actually not related to entry point. Seems to have just stopped updating for some reason
- This will require a lot of testing

If treatment never started we shouldn't put down a last position flag

Flythrough error does not unset?

Doesn't check the chaperone state ever past initial connection connection

Onboard computer logs aren't good.
	- Multiple logs are started. Seems to be related to the chaperone because, it causes another log file to start. Maybe check by process ID?
	- Time and date is wrong because the Pi never knows the time and date. Update it from ACE?

--- LOW

Scroll down in Mission when opening a new tab

Disconnection causes three disconnect messages in MissionControl
	- Fixed?

Unnecessary no connection messages

--- MULTI-DRONE

Alert grid stops receiving alerts after switching between drones. CollectionChanged event sub/unsub fires properly
	- Still happens!!
	- Switched to only allow one drone as a safety workaround

Button to exclude emulation drones from the drone list

Save and restore instruction and connection details

--- FUTURE

Mission Control Core text isn't translated

Onboard Computer text isn't translated

Change to consider: You can only ever fly one route at a time... So should we just select one route in ACE
- Can we get RouteUpload objects from the UgCS server?

Reset Defaults config button(s)

When the route starts within the treatment area it sets the start point as it exits.
	- This is because it is still the "first intersection"
	- Should be easy to fix but my first attempt failed.
	- Easier to work around with different start modes. Leaving it for now.

TCP "pinging" is not reliable, at least on busy slow networks - create ping script to execute
	- Not working for Gabe
	- Should switch to using DNS-SD/mDNS to discover devices on the network
